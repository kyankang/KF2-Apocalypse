NM_DedicatedServer fixes

Most importantly, this commit disables a gametype integrity check
that TWI appears to have added after v1043 to make quickjoin less
buggy.  The problem is that it executes every time the map changes,
and it kicks everyone if the gametype is not standard.  CD's is
not standard.

I disabled this check. It didn't exist in v1043, and it's not
really necessary for a custom gametype.

This commit also contains two less-important fixes:

* made CD_ConsolePrinter stop spamming (noisily but harmlessly)
  about CachedGVC being None when running in dedicated server mode

* expanded FakePlayers value range from [0,5] to [0,32]

* GetNextSpawnList() was substantially modified upstream.  TWI made
  it so that new squads are not appended to the LeftoverSpawnSquad
  unless LSS is incapable of supplying AINeeded.  This means that LSS
  no longer grows monotonically in solo play.  Indeed, it's now hard
  to get LSS.Length above single digits, and it is routinely emptied
  during play now.

  This has the side effect of slowing down the spawnrate, because
  LSS.Length > 0 triggers an early "return 0" in
  CalcNextSpawnGroupTime(). Now that LSS is kept small and repeatedly
  emptied midwave, CNSGT() uses this early return less often, resulting
  in more time overall between the first zed spawn and the last, assuming
  the team kills fewer than a squad's worth of enemies each second (~5).

  The preceding version of the game (v1043) only really applied any
  spawnrate modifiers, including CD SpawnMod, for the first few squads.
  After the first few squads spawned, and assuming the player killed less
  than an entire squad a second on average, LeftoverSpawnSquad's size
  would grow effectively without bound, and this would trigger early
  return in CNSGT().  This basically meant the game overrode SpawnMod to
  zero after the first few squads.  So, it is possible to emulate v1043
  behavior by setting SpawnMod=0 in this new version.  It's not exactly
  the same -- SpawnMod=0 is actually slightly harder, because you don't
  get any slack for those first few squads -- but it is close.

  In the long term, this is probably a good move by TWI, because it
  makes SpawnMod influential throughout the wave instead of just for
  the first few squads.  For that reason, and because a similar and
  slightly more difficult behavior can be simulated with SpawnMod=0,
  I've decided to adopt TWI's new behavior in CD.  Maintaining the old
  behavior as an option would have been kind of error-prone and clumsy.

  To follow this change, I copied GetNextSpawnList() from TWI's
  KFAISpawnManager and reapplied my CD customizations (which relate
  to disabling spawn shuffling when a SpawnCycle is in use).

* TWI renamed sDifficultyWaveInfo to DifficultyWaveInfo.  CD used this
  struct in a couple of places.  The actual struct contents and field
  names have not changed, just the name of the struct type.

* Added basic_heavy preset.  Thanks to Dandy Boy for helping me tune this
  preset.

* New SpawnCycle option for deterministic spawns

  This feature takes the luck out of what zeds spawn and when.  No
  more guessing about whether you'll get 3FP or just 2SC.  It lets you
  control what zeds spawn, in what squads, on what waves, in what
  order.  This covers everything from big zed squads down to every
  last crawler.  The only thing it does not cover is boss waves.

  If you want, you can exercise full control over every spawn by
  writing your own detailed SpawnCycle in KFGame.ini and setting
  SpawnCycle=ini.  Or, you can use the SpawnCycle=basic_moderate
  preset included in this release, in which case you don't have to
  touch KFGame.ini at all.

  Detailed documentation on this feature is available here:
  https://github.com/notblackout/kf2-controlled-difficulty/blob/master/spawn.md

  However, to just get started as quickly as possible without reading
  anything, run this:

  `open KF-Hillside-B4?game=ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival?SpawnCycle=basic_moderate`

  After the map loads, type this to see a summary of what you're about
  to play:

  `CDSpawnSummaries`

  This basic_moderate preset feels similar to a roughly average HOE
  Long game, with a few tweaks:

  * Big zed presence increases smoothly and linearly, so that each
    wave is a slight but distinct step up from the preceding wave.
    There is a total of 54 bigs over the entire long game.
  
  * Only 47 husks spawn over the course of the entire game.  This is
    only about two-thirds-ish the normal number of husks.  The husks
    also tend to spawn one at a time.

* New Boss=hans|patriarch|unmodded option

  This controls which boss spawns at the end of a game.  It can be set
  to unmodded to keep the default random behavior.

  New AlbinoAlphas option to complement existing AlbinoCrawlers option

  A past release introduced AlbinoCrawlers, but there was no way to
  control whether albino alpha clots would spawn.  The new
  AlbinoAlphas=true|false option does just that.

  As noted in the documentation, activating a SpawnCycle effectively
  disables the AlbinoAlphas and AlbinoCrawlers options.  Whether and
  when albinos spawn is controlled by the SpawnCycle definition, in
  that case.  basic_moderate has no albinos whatsoever, so you will
  not see any when playing that preset no matter what the
  AlbinoAlphas/-Crawlers options are set to.

* Logging cleanup

  The old "(GameConductor woken up) ControlledDifficulty forcing
  SpawnMod =..." message no longer spams once a second into the log.
  The underlying functionality has not changed, I just removed this
  extremely noisy log message.

  The mod is also much more consistent about honoring
  bLogControlledDifficulty.  When bLogControlledDifficulty=false, the
  only bits it unconditionally logs are error messages and a copy of
  the information it prints to console (because the console doesn't
  support copy-paste, but logfiles do).

* Added AlbinoCrawlers=true|false option

  When this is false, the game forces all crawlers to be regular black
  crawlers.  Effectively, whenever the standard game would have
  spawned an albino/gas crawler, AlbinoCrawlers=false converts that
  crawler to a regular/non-gas one.  This neither reduces zed count
  nor changes the squad or zed composition of a wave, aside from
  replacing albino crawlers with regular ones.

* Mod version and build date now print to console

  This console line appears just above the lines displaying CD's
  active settings.

  I use abbreviated git commit hashes as version descriptors.  If you
  wish, you can cross-reference the version string against the github
  project's master branch history to see the exact source code you are
  running:

* Fixed save-and-load for SpawnMod

  The last build failed to save SpawnMod values to KFGame.ini.
  SpawnMod was still displayed in the console and applied to the game
  correctly.  You were affected by this if you left the SpawnMod
  parameter off the `open` command and saw CD print a SpawnMod value
  to the console that you did not expect.  The value printed to the
  console was the effective one.

* fixed SpawnMod=0 handling
    Prior to this commit, specifying SpawnMod=0 as a parameter to the open
    command had unintuitive behavior that depended on whether a saved
    SpawnMod value was present in KFGame.ini.

    * If you ran `open ...?SpawnMod=0` and KFGame.ini had a
      [ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival] section with a SpawnMod value
      (true if KFGame.ini is not readonly and you've played the mod
      before), then the KFGame.ini value was used (which might not be 0!)

    * If you ran `open ...?SpawnMod=0` and KFGame.ini had no SpawnMod
      value (true if you never played the mod before or if KFGame.ini is
      readonly), 0.0 was used

    I recommended that people stick to the range [0.75, 1.0] in the mod
    description, but I probably should have foreseen that people would try
    0.0 even though it was not recommended.  I see that Kore and Fat Cat
    have already tried SpawnMod=0, for instance.

    The true SpawnMod value appears in the log, but people don't usually
    run KF2 with the `-log` option, so that doesn't help them.

    I've made a couple of changes to fix this.

    1. I rewrote the parameter handling to avoid the KFGame.ini-dependence
    mentioned above.  Now if you run `open ...?SpawnMod=0`, you will
    actually get SpawnMod=0 regardless of KFGame.ini or anything else.
    Note that the spawning subsytem in the base game still only spawns one
    squad of zeds per second, and squads tend to be about 5 zeds in size,
    give or take a couple.  So, even with SpawnMod=0, it could take
    several seconds to reach the MaxMonsters limit.

    2. I made the mod print its effective configuration values to the
    console every time you run the `open` command (technically, this
    happens in the `InitGame()` function).  So, when you open a map with
    the mod, you now see something like printed to your console:

    [ControlledDifficulty] FakePlayers=2
    [ControlledDifficulty] TraderTime=45
    [ControlledDifficulty] SpawnMod=0.75
    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=<unmodded default>

    To those who set SpawnMod=0 and got burned by this weird
    KFGame.ini-dependence, I apologize.  I hope the change above will make
    the mod's effective values more transparent, in addition to just
    fixing this specific problem.

* added MaxMonsters param
    Before this commit, the mod did not alter the vanilla game's
    MaxMonsters logic.  MaxMonsters is an int correspoding to the maximum
    amount of concurrent live zeds the spawning subsystem allows on a map.
    In the vanilla game, dedicated servers use 32 (even if you play by
    yourself on a dedicated server), whereas non-dedicated (NM_StandAlone)
    use 16.  So, if you run KF2 and open a modded game from the main menu,
    you had MaxMonsters=16, consistent with the vanilla game.

    This is now configurable.  You can append ?MaxMonsters=32 or whatever
    you like.  Values greater than zero are interpreted literally.  For
    instance, if you specify ?MaxMonsters=32, you will see this printed to
    the console after the map loads:

    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=32

    Nonpositive values are interpreted to mean "use the vanilla game's
    MaxMonsters" (which will be 16 if you play non-dedicated solo).  For
    instance, if you specify ?MaxMonsters=0 or ?MaxMonsters=-1 (or any
    other negative value), you will see this printed to the console after
    the map loads:

    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=<unmodded default>

* fixed delayed param handling on FakePlayers and TraderTime
    mike5879 noticed that changes to the FakePlayers and TraderTime
    options only take effect after running the open command twice.  It was
    as though changes to these values were delayed by one invocation of
    `open` command.  Fortunately, this only affected FakePlayers and
    TraderTime, which are easy to check.  It did not affect SpawnMod.

    This was caused by an ordering bug in my config handling code.  This
    is now fixed.  All options specified on the `open` command line should
    take effect immediately (and they will also be saved to KFGame.ini if
    it is not readonly, as happens already).
